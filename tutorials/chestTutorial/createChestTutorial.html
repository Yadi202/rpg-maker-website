      <p> In this tutorial we will be going over how to create a chest in RPG Maker along with what are some of the posibilities that can be used when creating chests </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../../photos/treasure/tutorialStart.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>When you load up the map the first thing you want to do is click the little red guy in the middle top left of the screen. This is the event creator. The event creator is exactly what it sounds like... it creates events. Now events
          basically
          are things that happen in the game. A really good game will have tons of these and really are the heart and soul of the game.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../../photos/treasure/tutorialeventmake.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Now right click the spot where you want the chest to be</p3>
          <br>
          <img src="../../photos/treasure/tutorialeventmakerightclick.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>Now go down the menu and select the quick creation and click the treasure button</p>
          <br>
          <img src="../../photos/treasure/tutorialtreasureevent.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>Now it brings up the treasure window. From here you can decide what type of treasure you want to put inside of the chest. You can either decide items you want to put in the chest or put gold instead or possibly both!</p>
          <br>
          <img src="../../photos/treasure/treasurewindow.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>Now that the window is open select what you would like to do. in this case we will be creating a chest with a potion in it so that when the character approachs and opens it they get rewarded with a potion.</p>
          <br>
          <img src="../../photos/treasure/treasureselect.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>Now the chest should be made and the treasure should be inside. Run the game and test it out!</p>
